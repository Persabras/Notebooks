At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors; behind one door there was a prize and the other two had a goat behind them. If the contestant did not pick the prize door on his or her first try, Monty Hall would open one of the two remaining doors and show the contestant that there was no prize behind that door.<br>\n","So you're left with two doors, the one you picked and one door that you do not know what's behind it. So then Monty Hall would ask, do you want to switch doors? What would you do? We can use probability to show that if you stick to the original door, your chance of winning a car or whatever big prize is 1 in 3; but if you switch your chance doubles to 2 in 3.<br><br>   \n","This seems counterintuitive; many people incorrectly think both chances are 1 in 2 since there are only 2 doors left. You can find detailed exploration through the provided links of mathematics of how you can calculate that this is in fact wrong and that you have a higher chance if you switch. But here we're going to use a Monte Carlo simulation to show that this is the case and this will help you understand how it all works.</div>\n","\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","<br>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b9334d7e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.003118,"end_time":"2022-10-05T21:28:11.28084","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-10-05T21:28:11.277722","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <div style=\"width:100%;text-align: center; font-size:45px; font-family:Optima; font-weight:300; text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px #aaa;\"> Scenario one.
